# Winter Break Project - Sumikko Gurashi Gacha Game

The purpose of this project was to build a game for my girlfriend during my winter break to consolidate what I've learned so far (Javascript, localStorage, CSS tricks, etc). Basically you pull for characters you want and it keeps track of what characters you have and how much it would cost to get the character of your choice since each character has a different probability of being pulled.

## General Setup

Just clone it and run the `index.html` and you should be good(?). You can also visit the domain at `sumikkogurashigacha.com` for the already deployed site if you don't feel like cloning.

## Walkthrough

There's not much to it, just "buy" gems, and pull your favorite character. Below is a screenshot of what the UI `(User Interface)` currently looks like (it's still a work in progress).
